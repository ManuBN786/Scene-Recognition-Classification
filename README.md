This Matlab code can classify the test dataset into 15 different categories namely 'Bedroom','Coast','Forest','Highway','Industrial','InsideCity','Kitchen','LivingRoom','Mountain','Office','OpenCountry','Store','Street','Suburb','TallBuilding'.
The dataset can be downloaded from:
http://www-cvr.ai.uiuc.edu/ponce_grp/data/scene_categories/scene_categories.zip

If not drop a comment below, I will mail it to you.
How to Run ?
1. Place the files in the path of Matlab
2. Make sure the test images are placed in a folder named 'testing'
3. Just run Classify_Scene.m
4. The results will be stored in a 'Results.txt' file
Suggestions and Comments are always welcome.

Thanks in advance,
